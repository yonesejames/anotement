<center><p>This is a web application that allows users to create, edit, update, and delete organizational items such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notes</li>
  <li>To Do Lists</li>
  <li>Reminders</li>
  <li>Video URLs</li>
  <li>And more to come!</li>
</ul>

<p>This idea started with my equal parts fascination and obsession with <b>Notion</b>. I consider myself a well organized individual and plan everything, so I wanted to create an app that showcase my passions.</p>

<p>This application currently has Flask, Jinja, and React with a few HTML and CSS. The reason why I chose these languages, framework, etc. is because I am currently learning Flask and wan to learn React in the future.</p>

<p>This app is still a work in progress and I still have bugs to fix, so I did not want to put it on Github until I was more or less satisfied with my initial start.</p>
